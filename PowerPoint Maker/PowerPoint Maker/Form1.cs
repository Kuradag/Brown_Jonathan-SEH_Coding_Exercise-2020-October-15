/* Author: Jonathan Brown
 * Date: October 15th, 2020
 * Directions:
 * 
 * Create a solution that a user can use to aid them in generating a power 
 * point slide. They want the solution to give them suggestions of images 
 * to use form the internet (Google) based on the contents of the 
 * information they are using for the slide. They want to improve 
 * efficiency and save time not having to search for images for every 
 * slide they are making for their presentations.
 * 
 * Create a solution that accepts user input
 * 
 *     Title area (input)
 *     Text area (input)
 *     image suggestion area (multiple selection); utilize words in the 
 *     title, and bold words in the text area to bring suggested images in, 
 *     with ability to select multiple images to be included in the slide 
 * 
 *  
 * 
 * Final solution should use title, text areas, and using selected images to 
 * build power point slide.
 * Power point slide(s) should be the output.
 * 
 * Comments: This project should probably use VSTO Add-ins for Office, but due
 * to limited time, it seems ideal to focus on the assignment.
